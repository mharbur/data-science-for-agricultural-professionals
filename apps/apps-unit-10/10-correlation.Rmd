Experiment with the application below.  What happens as you adjust the value of r using the slider control?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput("corrCoef", "Select R", min=-1, max = 1, step = 0.05, value = 0.8)
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("corrPlot", width = "600px", height="600px")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$corrPlot = renderPlot({
    set.seed(1234)
    n = 1000
    r = input$corrCoef
    x1 = rnorm(n)
    x2 = rnorm(n)
    y1 = scale(x2) * r  +  scale(residuals(lm(x1~x2))) * sqrt(1-r*r)
    
    r = cor(y1,x2)
    
    cor_data = cbind(y1, x2) %>%
      as.data.frame() 
    
    cor_data %>%
      rename(y=V1, 
             x=x2) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_text(x=3.5, y=3.5, label=paste0("r = " , r), color="blue", size=8) + 
      lims(x=c(-4,4), y=c(-4,4)) +
      coord_fixed()
      })

    
}

shinyApp(ui, server, options = list(height="600px", width="1000px"))
```

When r is close to zero, the “cloud” of data in the scatter plot will appear circular.  As r increases positively, the data will start to look like a football – with its nose pointed up and right and its tail pointed down and left.  As r gets closer to 1, the data may represent a cigar – or an under-inflated football (yes, I’m talking to you, Brady).  And as r gets very close to 1, the data cloud will resemble a straight line.  As r increases negatively, the same patterns occur, only with the data points converging on a diagonal line that slopes up and to the left.
